# Pong

Pong is a modified version of the game "Mini Tennis" found in this site: http://www.edu4java.com/en/game/game0-en.html. 

This is a two player game. Player 1 takes control of the racquet found on the upper side of the screen while Player 2 takes the one on the lower side of the screen. The objective of the game is simple. The players can move their racquets in two directions: LEFT and RIGHT. They will try to catch the moving ball and get a point if they succeed in hitting it back towards the opponent.
